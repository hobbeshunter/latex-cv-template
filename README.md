# latex-cv-template
This is a CV template written in latex. Have a look at `main.pdf` to see what it looks like.  It is greatly inspired by some template for libre office I saw long time ago, but can't find anymore.

## Adapt

Simply edit `main.tex`.

If you want to change some spacings you have to look into `cv-style.cls`. In the colors section in `cv-style.cls` you can also change the accent color.

## Build

Simply build as usual or use the docker container that has all dependencies ready.

```sh
$ ./latexdockercmd.sh
```

## Contribute

Feel free to propose improvements via pull requests or issues.
